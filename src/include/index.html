    <h1>{greeting}, I'm Cheru!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm on a gap year working @ <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, & {location_text}.</p>
<p>This website isn't fancy, but hey, I just started it {time_ago}.
<br>(The code is pretty cool, though; check out the <a href="https://github.com/recursiveforte/v4">GitHub</a>. Or don't.)</p>
<p>I love:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Rust programming language (my first!)</li>
    <li>Music! Some of my favs are {random_artist_1} & {random_artist_2}.</li>
    <li><a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> (esp. <a href="https://sprig.hackclub.com">Sprig</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't love:</p>
<ul>
    <li>JavaScript, in principle</li>
    <li>Over-optimization (Ã  la Goodhart's Law)</li>
</ul>

<p>The three guiding principles of my life (click to expand):</p>
<ul class="dropdowns">
    <li><details>
        <summary>I have agency! So do you.</summary>
        <p>In other words- you can do anything! Pretty much every problem can be solved w/ either a lot of effort or a lot of money.</p>
        <p>This is something I realized two summers ago, when I met some of my best friends at a <a href="https://outernet.hackclub.com/">hackathon in the woods</a>
            - I realized (a) they were cool people because they were predisposed to do unconventional things & (b) I can just <em>do things!</em> The only thing that had been stopping me is the fact that I wasn't aware that I could.</p>
        <p>I decided to leave high school early, move out, and work full-time on the things that mattered to me because it's what was best for me. It was difficult logistically, but all social systems are malleable if you push hard enough.</p>
    </details></li>
    <li><details>
        <summary>People are the most important thing.</summary>
        <p>I used to have this belief that engineering was the one true profession - while the work of those in operational fields would eventually be forgotten, inventions would last forever.</p>
        <p>If you spend your life doing something that will never benefit anyone else, what's the point? Making an impact on people is the only reason we do anything- make it a positive impact. Value everyone.</p>
    </details></li>
    <li><details>
        <summary>We're all going to die anyways.</summary>
        <p>Maybe-unpopular take: what we do during our lives doesn't matter. "We die, then it's over / So fuck being sober" <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1aBCdCoHR7AwWQbiWEHdzA?si=f0d2be00d0544892">(Annika Wells)</a>.</p>
        <p>So: Take risks! Enjoy life! The failure case is never as bad as you think it will be.<br>Don't be pressured to take the safest path, and don't be tempted to take the easiest path; "Itâ€™s all so meaningless, we may as well be extraordinary" (Francis Bacon).</p>

<p>(not-so-)FAQ:</p>

        <summary>Where are you in life?</summary>
        <p>Physically? I'm {location_text}.</p>
        <p>Professionally? I'm writing software, currently on the <a href="https://sprig.hackclub.com">Sprig</a> project.</p>

    </details></li>
    <li><details>
        <summary>What is your quest?</summary>
        <p>Honestly, idk. Ironically, I'm still searching for purpose. <br>As much as I am uncomfortable with that, I think it's mostly okay.</p>
        <p>Conveniently (or maybe intentionally?), the things I find fun are also the skills that will probably help me in the future- so I'm just riding that train for now.</p>
